VBScript, Batch Programming 

As newbie to the Windows command line interface, the idea of malware and VBScript...I go on a journey to learn about the various utilities in the Windows command line interface and try to create malware out of these utilities using batch programming and VBScript. I also turn to VBScript to create my version of malware using MS Word functionality.
